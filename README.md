# One Page Docs Generator

The purpose of this project is to generate a single compiled HTML file containing all of the content gathered from sections of a given website, in order to have all the information available in one place without having to navigate to separate pages. This is done by scraping the given website. 

After compilation the HTML file will be displayed in the browser, and a PDF can be generated for printing (Print > Save as PDF in Chrome for example).

This project is under development and will be made into a globally installable NPM module in the future.
